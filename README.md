# Game flow
Each player will select his three champions to form his team. The champions will take turns
based on their speed. The champion with the highest speed (from all selected champions) will
begin acting first followed by the champion with the second highest speed and so on. When
the turn goes to a champion, the player controlling the champion can use him to carry out any
action as long as the champion has enough action points needed for this action and also enough
mana in case of using any of his abilities. After that, the champion can end his turn and the
turn will go to the next champion.
The turns will keep passing over the living champions till a player is able to defeat all of the
three champions of the opponent player. In this case, the game ends and the player with the
living champion will be declared the winner.
